The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my data visualization skills by creating a Tableau page based on the Netflix dataset. Through this project, I aim to showcase my proficiency in SQL for data analysis and Tableau for creating interactive and visually appealing visualizations.

The Tableau page can be accessed https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/monti7025/viz/NetflixData_16841282577520/Dashboard1?publish=yes (link to tableau page).
