This project showcases my data visualization skills by creating a tableau page for the Covid-19 deaths from 2020-2022. The goal of this project is not to make any political statement but rather to present my abilities in creating interactive and informative data visualizations.

The data used in this project is publicly available Covid-19 death statistics. I have included predictions for the next two years, assuming the current rates of Covid-19 deaths continue.

I have used various visualization techniques to display the data in an understandable and engaging manner. I have also added filters to allow for a more interactive user experience.

Tableau Page
The Tableau page can be accessed https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/monti7025/viz/GlobalCovid-19Rates2020-2022/Dashboard1?publish=yes (link to tableau page).

Please note that the data used is for visualization purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice.
