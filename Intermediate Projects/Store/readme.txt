I chose to use Python and Django to create a inventory for my local video game store because I wanted a system that was reliable, easy to use, and comprehensive. I found that Django provided the perfect platform for my needs, allowing me to customize it to suit the store's specific inventory needs. The combination of Python and Django also gave me the ability to quickly create and modify the inventory, saving me time and energy in the long run.
