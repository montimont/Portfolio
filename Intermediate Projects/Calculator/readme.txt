I chose to use Python and Tkinter to create a simple calculator because it is an easy-to-use and powerful programming language that allows for quick development of a calculator with a graphical user interface. Python is also suitable for creating a calculator because it has a wide range of available mathematical functions and libraries for performing calculations and manipulating data. Additionally, Tkinter is a popular Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces, which is ideal for creating a calculator with a user-friendly interface. With Tkinter, I can easily create buttons, labels, and other widgets to create a simple calculator. Finally, Python is an open source language, meaning that anyone can use and modify the code, making it easy to customize the calculator to my needs.
