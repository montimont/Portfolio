This portfolio consists of a project I completed during my Python course. I used Python to clone the popular Flappy Birds game in this project. I implemented a genetic algorithm called NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (N.E.A.T.) to teach the A.I. to play the game. The game involves a bird that needs to fly through a series of pipes without hitting them. The A.I.'s goal was to learn how to play the game well and achieve a high score.
To build the game and the A.I., I used the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The N.E.A.T. algorithm utilized a population of neural networks (N.N.) to train the A.I. to play the game. Each N.N. was evaluated based on its ability to achieve a high score. The N.N.s that performed well were kept, and those that performed poorly were discarded.
This project was a challenging and rewarding experience for me. I learned how to use Python to create a game and how to use N.E.A.T. to teach the A.I. to play it. Ultimately, I could make a fully functional game with an A.I. that could learn and play the game proficiently.
The Flappy Birds clone and A.I. implementation can be run on any computer with Python and Pygame installed. 
Overall, this project showcases my skills in game development and machine learning. It also highlights my eagerness to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I am proud of what I have accomplished with this project and look forward to further enhancing my abilities in these areas.
