This portfolio consists of a project I completed while taking a Python course. In this project, I used Python to clone the classic game of Pong. Additionally, I used a genetic algorithm called NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (N.E.A.T.) to teach the A.I. to play the game.
Pong is a two-player game that involves moving paddles up and down to hit a ball back and forth between them. The goal for the A.I. was to learn how to play the game well and to score as many points as possible.
I used the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The N.E.A.T. algorithm used a population of neural networks (N.N.) to teach the A.I. how to play the game. Each N.N. was evaluated based on its ability to score points against a human player. The N.N.s that performed well were kept, and those that performed poorly were discarded.
The project was both challenging and rewarding. I learned how to use Python to create a game and how to use N.E.A.T. to teach the A.I. to play it. In the end, I was able to create a functioning game with an A.I. that could learn how to play it. In addition, this project helped me improve my Python skills and gave me hands-on experience with machine-learning techniques.
The Pong clone and A.I. implementation can be run on any computer with Python and Pygame installed. Additionally, the code is available on my GitHub repository for anyone who wants to learn from or build upon my project.
Overall, this project showcases my game development and machine learning abilities. In addition, it demonstrates my willingness to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I am proud of what I have accomplished with this project and am excited to continue improving my skills in these areas.
