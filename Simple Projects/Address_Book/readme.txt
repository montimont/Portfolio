I used Python code with the sqlite3 and datetime modules to create an address book because these modules are lightweight and easy to use. Additionally, the sqlite3 module allows me to store the address book data in an external SQL file, which can be easily retrieved and modified using the various functions built into the code. The datetime module will also store the date and time when a contact is added or edited. This address book will be capable of viewing all contacts, creating new contacts, removing contacts, and editing existing contacts. All changes will be reflected in the external SQL file, allowing users to keep track of the contacts they have added and edited over time.
