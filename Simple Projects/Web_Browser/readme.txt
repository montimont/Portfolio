I used Python and the PyQt6 library to create a basic web browser with go, forward, and backward capabilities. PyQt6 is a library that provides many useful functions for quickly building graphical user interfaces, which was a significant factor in my decision. Furthermore, I used the QtWebEngine library to create the browser window and the PyQt6 WebEngineView class to provide basic web navigation. I then added buttons to allow users to go back and forth within the visited pages' history. Finally, I created a search bar to enable users to enter URLs and navigate to different web pages.
