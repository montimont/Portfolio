I have always had a passion for traveling, which has inspired me to write Python code to exchange currency. To have a minimal viable product, I capped the limit to five currencies (GBP, CAD, CNY, EUR, and USD). I am considering adding an external API. However, it would destroy the simplicity of this project. Perhaps I would remake this with more bells and whistles in a future project.
