I chose to use Python's tkinter and time packages to create my clock because they provided the most efficient way to make a user-friendly interface for a clock with time, time zone, date, and time of day elements. Tkinter offered a variety of methods to create a graphical user interface for the clock, and the time package had a rich set of functions that allowed me to access the time and date elements needed for the clock. Furthermore, the time package also provided options to easily access and update the time zone and time of day elements essential for this clock.
